## Data Driven Reachability Analysis using Matrix Zonotopes
<br /> 
We consider the problem of computing the set of states that a system can reach, <br />
which is commonly known as reachability analysis. This repo cotains the code for our paper:<br />

 System Model <br />



We consider the problem of reachability analysis from noisy data given that the system 
model is unknown. Identifying a model is a preliminary step in the state of the art 
reachability analysis approaches. However, systems are becoming more complex and data 
is becoming more readily available.<br />
