## Data-Enabled Reachability Analysis using the Fundamental Lemma

We propose data-enabled reachability analysis where we make use of input-state data
 trajectories to compute the reachable set. More specifically, using a finite number 
of data samples from an unknown system, we compute reachable sets based on the data-driven
 fundamental lemma by making use of data-enabled system representation sorted into Hankel matrices.<br />


## Data Driven Reachability Analysis from Noisy Data with Unknown System Model
We consider the problem of reachability analysis from noisy data given that the system 
model is unknown. Identifying a model is a preliminary step in the state of the art 
reachability analysis approaches. However, systems are becoming more complex and data 
is becoming more readily available.<br />
